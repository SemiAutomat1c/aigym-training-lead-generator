# Template Updates

## New Templates Added

We've added three new templates with different sender names:

1. **Max - Company Account**
   - Sender: Max
   - Type: Company Account (initial outreach)
   - Format: Similar to the original company template but with "Max" as the sender

2. **BOB - Follow-up**
   - Sender: Bob
   - Type: Follow-up message that mentions Max
   - Format: "Bob here, i'm not too sure if my friend Max has reached out to you yet, @max_apolloss"

3. **MATTHEW - Follow-up**
   - Sender: Matthew
   - Type: Follow-up message that mentions Max
   - Format: "Matthew here, i'm not too sure if my friend Max has reached out to you yet, @max_apolloss"

## Template Selection Logic

The template dropdown now includes all five options:

1. **Company Account (Jet)** - Original company account template with Jet as the sender
2. **Max - Company Account** - Company account template with Max as the sender
3. **Normal Follow-up (Bob)** - Original follow-up template that mentions Jet
4. **BOB - Follow-up** - Follow-up template with Bob mentioning Max
5. **MATTHEW - Follow-up** - Follow-up template with Matthew mentioning Max

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/services/messageTemplates.ts**
   - Added template parameter to `generateTemplateMessage` function
   - Implemented conditional logic for different templates
   - Added specific formatting for each template type

2. **src/services/aiService.ts**
   - Added new functions for each template type:
     - `getMaxCompanyMessage`
     - `getBobFollowUpMessage`
     - `getMatthewFollowUpMessage`
   - Updated `generateMessage` function to handle the new template types

3. **src/components/MessageGenerator.tsx**
   - Updated template dropdown options to include the new templates

4. **src/components/BatchMessageGenerator.tsx**

### Testing

A test script has been created at `src/test-templates.js` with instructions for verifying the new templates.

To test:
1. Run the application
2. Enter a test lead with name and traits
3. Select each template and verify the correct sender name appears
4. Verify that the BTW and PS sections show appropriate content based on the traits
