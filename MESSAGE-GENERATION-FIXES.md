# Message Generation Quality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Grammar and Natural Language Issues
- Fixed incorrect grammar patterns for professions:
  - ❌ "saw that you're into health worker" → ✅ "saw that you're a health worker"
  - ❌ "saw that you're into real estate agent" → ✅ "saw that you're a real estate agent"
  - ❌ "saw that you're into designer" → ✅ "saw that you're a designer"

### 2. Trait Parsing Issues
- Fixed handling of compound traits with social media handles:
  - ❌ Treating "works at (ig/mindmusclesg)" as just "mindmusclesg"
  - ✅ Now properly recognizes "works at (ig/mindmusclesg)" as a complete trait

### 3. PS Line Mismatches
- Improved PS line generation to match the person's traits:
  - Added special handling for "awesome coat" and similar appearance traits
  - Ensured PS lines for social media handles reference the handle correctly
  - Added fallback to first trait if second trait doesn't generate a good PS line

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Trait Parsing Improvements
- Updated `parseInputForTemplate` function to properly handle social media handles and preserve them in traits
- Added special handling for parentheses content to prevent incorrect splitting

### 2. Grammar Pattern Fixes
- Updated `generateFirstTraitMessage` function to use correct grammar patterns:
  - For professions: "saw that you're a [profession]"
  - For hobbies: "saw that you're into [hobby]" or "saw your [hobby]"
  - For appearance: "saw your [item]"
- Added detection logic to identify profession traits vs. hobby traits

### 3. PS Line Generation Fixes
- Updated `generateSecondTraitMessage` function to handle appearance traits naturally
- Added special case handling for "awesome coat" to generate appropriate responses
- Added trait categorization helper functions to determine appropriate response formats
- Implemented fallback mechanism to use first trait for PS if second trait doesn't generate a good match

### 4. Testing
- Created a test script and sample inputs to verify the fixes
- Documented expected outputs for various trait combinations
